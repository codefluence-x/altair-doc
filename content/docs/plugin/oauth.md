## Introduction

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows applications to gain limited access to user accounts on HTTP services, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts user accounts, and authorizing third-party applications to access user accounts. OAuth2 provides authorization streams for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices.
