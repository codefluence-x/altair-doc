## Getting Started with Docker

If you already know what docker is and want to take a quick jump into altair configuration and implementation, you can use this section as your guide.

### Run Altair with Docker-Compose

We are at the [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codefluence/altair)! A common implementation of the docker Altair is to have a directory where you store the config and routes folders in it.

```
config/
routes/
.env
docker-compose.yml
```

The docker-compose content could look like this:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  altair:
    image: codefluence/altair:latest
    volumes:
      - ./routes/:/opt/altair/routes/
      - ./config/:/opt/altair/config/
      - ./.env:/opt/altair/.env
    ports:
      - "1304:1304"
    network_mode: host
    env_file: ./.env
```

After that, you can start Altair with the command `docker-compose up`. It will serve Altair in http://localhost:1304.

## Getting Started with Window, Linux and Mac
